# Car Price Prediction Project
Car Price Prediction Project: Developed predictive models to analyze factors influencing car prices using a comprehensive dataset. Performed EDA, correlation analysis, and built models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest ((R^2): 0.89). 

#### **Project Description**  
This project focuses on building predictive models to estimate car prices based on various attributes such as engine size, fuel type, horsepower, and more. The dataset consists of car specifications and prices, and the goal is to identify the factors that influence pricing and develop robust models for accurate predictions.  

#### **Key Features**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Performed detailed EDA to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset.  
  - Analyzed relationships between car attributes and prices using heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots.  

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity.  
  - Applied encoding techniques to convert categorical data into numerical formats.  

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Trained multiple machine learning models, including:  
    - Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet  
    - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost  
    - XGBoost, LightGBM, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
  - Evaluated models using \( R^2 \), RMSE, and other metrics.  

- **Best Model Selection:**  
  - Random Forest achieved the best performance with an \( R^2 \) of 0.89 on the test set and the lowest RMSE of 2500.23.  

#### **Insights**  
- Larger engines, higher horsepower, and heavier cars correlate with higher prices.  
- Diesel cars are generally priced higher than gas cars.  
- Convertible body types are the most expensive, while hatchbacks are the least expensive.  

#### **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM  

#### **Conclusion**  
This project successfully identifies key factors influencing car prices and provides actionable insights for market strategy and product design. The models can be utilized to predict car prices accurately, supporting decision-making in the automotive industry.
